# ICS Timezone Fixer

A simple PHP script designed to solve a common issue when publishing `.ics` calendar files from Microsoft Exchange calendars to Google Calendar. When people subscribe to an Exchange calendar using Google Calendar, some timezones may be missing, which causes Google Calendar to default to UTC (00:00) for those events, leading to incorrect event times.

This script allows you to modify the `.ics` file to append any missing timezones, ensuring that all event times appear correctly in Google Calendar or any other calendar app that may face this issue.

## How It Works

The script:
1. Takes the URL of an `.ics` file as input (from the `ics_url` query parameter).
2. Inserts any missing timezone definitions.
3. Outputs the modified `.ics` file, ready for use.

## Quick Start

To use this tool directly, you can leverage the hosted version:

```plaintext
https://ics-changer.great-site.net/?ics_url=<original-link-to-calendar.ics>
```

Simply replace `<original-link-to-calendar.ics>` with your actual ICS file URL.

### Adding to Google Calendar

To add the modified `.ics` subscription calendar to Google Calendar:
1. Open Google Calendar.
2. In the left panel, find **Other calendars**.
3. Click the **+** button next to **Other calendars**, then select **From URL**.
4. Enter your modified ICS URL (e.g., `https://ics-changer.great-site.net/?ics_url=https://mysite.com/calendar.ics`).
5. Click **Add Calendar** to subscribe to the modified calendar.
